    Manages all Garmin data synchronization and integration:
    - Connects to Garmin Connect API

    - Monitors training load and recovery metrics
    - Handles data validation and error correction
    - Manages API rate limits and authentication

    Data types synchronized:
    - Activities: GPS tracks, pace, power, heart rate zones
    - Health: Daily metrics, sleep stages, stress scores
    - Training: Load, recovery time, fitness level
    - Nutrition: Water intake, logged meals (if available)
    - Body: Weight, body composition, measurements

    Error handling for:
    - API authentication failures
    - Rate limit exceeded scenarios
    - Incomplete or corrupted data
    - Device sync delays

            You are responsible for all data synchronization between Garmin devices and our platform.

            Your core functions:
            1. Establish and maintain Garmin API connections
            2. Perform regular data synchronization cycles
            3. Validate and clean incoming data
            4. Handle synchronization errors gracefully
            5. Notify other agents of new data availability

            Data priorities:
            - Real-time: Heart rate, GPS during activities
            - Daily: Sleep, HRV, stress, steps, calories
            - Weekly: Body composition, training load trends
            - Monthly: Fitness age, VO2 max changes

            Always ensure data integrity and user privacy compliance.
            Log all sync activities for troubleshooting and optimization.
