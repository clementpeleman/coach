## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose (for full development environment)
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Agno framework

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-coach-ai.git
   cd health-coach-ai
   ```

2. **Set up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   make setup
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. **Initialize Database**
   ```bash
   make db-init
   ```

5. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

6. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

## Code Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Code Formatting
We use automated code formatting tools:
```bash
make format  # Formats code with black and isort
make lint    # Runs linting checks
```

### Agent Development Guidelines

#### Creating New Agents
1. **Inherit from Base Patterns**
   ```python
   from agno.agent import Agent
   from config.models.model_config import ModelConfig

   class MySpecializedAgent:
       def __init__(self, knowledge_base=None):
           self.agent = Agent(
               name="My Specialized Agent",
               model=ModelConfig.get_model_for_agent("my_agent"),
               description="Clear description of agent purpose",
               instructions="Detailed instructions for the agent"
           )
   ```

2. **Follow Naming Conventions**
   - Agent files: `snake_case.py`
   - Agent classes: `PascalCaseAgent`
   - Methods: `snake_case`

3. **Include Comprehensive Documentation**
   ```python
   class MyAgent:
       """
       Brief description of the agent's purpose.

       Capabilities:
       - List specific capabilities
       - Include key responsibilities
       - Mention any limitations

       Usage:
       - When to use this agent
       - How it integrates with other agents
       """
   ```

#### Agent Best Practices
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
- **Stateless Design**: Agents should not maintain state between conversations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and fallback strategies
- **Performance**: Consider response time and cost optimization
- **Testing**: Include comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Database Guidelines

#### Model Design
```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class MyModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = "my_models"

    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    # Include comprehensive documentation
```

#### Migration Best Practices
- Always create migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations on development data
- Include rollback procedures
- Document breaking changes

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests for component interactions
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/         # Agent-specific tests
â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/      # Workflow tests
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/       # Test data and fixtures
â””â”€â”€ conftest.py     # Pytest configuration
```

#### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class TestMyAgent:
    @pytest.fixture
    def my_agent(self):
        return MyAgent()

    @pytest.mark.unit
    async def test_agent_functionality(self, my_agent):
        # Test implementation
        pass

    @pytest.mark.integration
    async def test_agent_integration(self, my_agent):
        # Integration test implementation
        pass
```

#### Test Categories
- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Fast, isolated tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Tests with external dependencies
- `@pytest.mark.slow`: Long-running tests
- `@pytest.mark.real_api`: Tests requiring real API connections

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-agents

# Run tests in watch mode
make test-watch
```

### Test Requirements
- **Coverage**: Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- **Speed**: Unit tests should complete in under 1 second
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on external services (use mocks)
- **Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
